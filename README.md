# Sales Insights Data Analysis Project

The sales team at AtliQ Hardware struggles with fragmented reporting and delayed insights due to manual data consolidation from various sources. 
To address this, a Sales Insight Dashboard is needed to centralize data visualization, enable real-time updates, and provide actionable insights. 
This dashboard will improve decision-making, enhance performance tracking, and streamline reporting processes. By leveraging advanced analytics and intuitive data visualizations, the sales team will be empowered to optimize strategies, increase efficiency, and drive higher revenue growth.

The accompanying PowerPoint presentation provides an in-depth overview of the project.
